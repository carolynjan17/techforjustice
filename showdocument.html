     <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 275px;">MOTION TO SEAL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RECORDS</p>

     <p>Pursuant to D.C. Code § 16-803, Joseph Public, respectfully moves this Honorable Court for an order to seal all publicly available records for each of the arrests and related court proceedings listed below.  D.C. Code§ 16-803(f) requires the movant to seal all eligible arrests and convictions in the same proceeding. 
     </p>

     <p>In support of this motion, movant states the following:<p>

     <p>1.      Movant was arrested on May 20, 2005. It was alleged that movant was arrested for a series of burglaries in the Very Nice neighborhood of Washington, DC. One Daisy Citizen was home during on      of the break-ins. Ms. Citizen was able to contact the police where upon Mr. Public was arrested. The movant was charged with Burglary - B & E. See Metropolitan Police Department Criminal History Record (Form PD-70) for Joseph public, PDID No. JP-3456, attached hereto as Exhibit A. This case resulted in a conviction on September 30, 2005. Movant was arrested, charged and/or convicted of an eligible misdemeanor or eligible felony conviction and movant is filing this motion more than ten (10) years after completing, the sentence, including all prison or jail time, probation, parole, and supervised release.
<b> The burden of proof is on the movant to show by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the interest of justice to grant relief.</b>
     </p>

    <p>2.       Movant has no pending cases, no convictions after the case in this motion and no conviction for an ineligible misdemeanor or an ineligible felony.</p>

     <p>3.      When making such a determination the Court shall consider the interests of the movant, the community's interest in keeping access to the records and the community's interest in sealing the records to increase the movant's chances of rehabilitation and employability. The Court may also consider facts surrounding the arrest and any other relevant information provided by the movant to support the claim that the relief sought is in the interests of justice or by the prosecution.
    </p>

    <p>4.      It is in the best interest of the movant to have his records sealed because "when I got out of jail a friend told me about getting a CDL. I always wanted to drive a truck. It took awhile but I finally got my CDL. Since September 2011 I've been working for the Big Enterprise Corporation. Big Enterprise has been good to me but I want to drive one of those big rigs. But because of my record no one will hire me. 

I make good money now but it's hard for me to get an apartment. I can afford my own place but when people see my record they won't rent to me. Right now I rent a room from one of the guys from my church."
    </p>

    <p>5.	It is in the best interest of the movant to have his records sealed because: "I was charged with burglary and Breaking and Entering. After I got out of jail I joined the Joyful Noise Baptist Church. There I gave my life to Christ and I hve not been the same since. My pastor taught me not to steal anymore but to go to work. I have a steady making deliveries to businesses. God has been good to me. I don't make deliveries to peoples houses."
    </p>

    <p>6.  The community also has an interest in having this arrest and conviction removed from the movant's permanent record because "My mother is sick. I try to help her out as much as I can. I would make more money if I could drive a truck cross country but no one will hire me because of my record."
    </p>

   <p>7.	The movant also requests his record be sealed because he has demonstrated a desire to move past this incident through his subsequent actions. For instance, The movant has worked at the Big Enterprise Corp., 10111 Fancy Corporate Place, Washington, DC, 20001 as a Delivery Truck Driver. His boss is Mr. E Bignow. The movant has obtained a CDL from the Long Range Trucking School. Finally, the movant has been a member of the Joyful Noise Baptist Church since his release from prison. There he serves as the worship leader. Rev. Alice Goodpastor is ther pastor.
    </p>

    <p> For the reasons set forth above and in the accompanying Memorandum, the movant requests that the Court order all publicly available records of movant's arrests, convictions, and related court proceedings be sealed.  See§ 16-803.
    </p>

     <p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for these and such other reasons as may appear to the Court, movant respectfully requests that the motion be granted.
